	<h1>Reporting Demonstrations</h1>
	<p>The following examples demonstrate how third-party developers
		can write web applications to query data from the dashboard and
		display reports:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>
			<a href="taskList.jsp">Task List</a>
		<dt>
		<dd>The list of tasks in this project that have been assigned to
			individuals. Demonstrates an HQL query against the TaskStatusFact
			table.</dd>
		<dt>
			<a href="timeLog.jsp">Time Log</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>The time log for this project. Demonstrates an HQL query
			against the TimeLogFact table, as well as the use of mapped process
			phases.</dd>
		<dt>
			<a href="defectLog.jsp">Defect Log</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>The defect log for this project. Demonstrates an HQL query
			against the DefectLogFact table.</dd>
		<dt>
			<a href="planSummary.jsp">Plan Summary</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>A partial plan summary for this project. Demonstrates the
			retrieval of precalculated metrics from the data repository.</dd>
		<dt>
			<a href="projectData">Component Data Dump</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>A CSV table of project data by component, in a CSV format
			that can be opened in Excel. Demonstrates the execution of multiple
			HQL queries from Java servlet logic (rather than directly from a
			JSP).</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Useful Tools</h2>
	<p>The following links can be helpful for report developers:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>
			<a href="hql.jsp">HQL Query Tester</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>This page will allow you to enter and run an HQL query. It
			can be a helpful way to test and debug problems with HQL syntax,
			content, etc.</dd>
		<dt>
			<a href="/control/reloadWARs">Reload WAR Files</a>
		</dt>
		<dd>If you are rebuilding WAR files and republishing them to a
			running dashboard, you can click the link above to reload the WAR
			files that have changed. (Note this link will not detect newly added
			WAR files; to accomplish that you must restart the dashboard.)</dd>
