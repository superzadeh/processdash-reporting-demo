<h1>Reporting Demonstrations</h1>

<p>The following examples demonstrate how third-party developers can write
web applications to query data from the dashboard and display reports:</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="taskList.jsp">Task List</a><dt>

    <dd>The list of tasks in this project that have been assigned to
    individuals.  Demonstrates an HQL query against the TaskStatusFact
    table.</dd>

<dt><a href="timeLog.jsp">Time Log</a></dt>

    <dd>The time log for this project. Demonstrates an HQL query against the
    TimeLogFact table, as well as the use of mapped process phases.</dd>

<dt><a href="defectLog.jsp">Defect Log</a></dt>

    <dd>The defect log for this project. Demonstrates an HQL query against the
    DefectLogFact table.</dd>

<dt><a href="planSummary.jsp">Plan Summary</a></dt>

    <dd>A partial plan summary for this project. Demonstrates the retrieval of
    precalculated metrics from the data repository.</dd>

<dt><a href="projectData">Component Data Dump</a></dt>

    <dd>A CSV table of project data by component, in a CSV format that can be
    opened in Excel.  Demonstrates the execution of multiple HQL queries from
    Java servlet logic (rather than directly from a JSP).</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Useful Tools</h2>

<p>The following links can be helpful for report developers:</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="hql.jsp">HQL Query Tester</a></dt>

    <dd>This page will allow you to enter and run an HQL query. It can be a
    helpful way to test and debug problems with HQL syntax, content, etc.</dd>

<dt><a href="/control/reloadWARs">Reload WAR Files</a></dt>

    <dd>If you are rebuilding WAR files and republishing them to a running
    dashboard, you can click the link above to reload the WAR files that
    have changed. (Note this link will not detect newly added WAR files; to
    accomplish that you must restart the dashboard.)</dd>
